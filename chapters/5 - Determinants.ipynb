    "## Cofactor Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to compute the determinant of a matrix is through cofactor expansion. Given an $\\ n \\times n $ matrix $\\ \\mathbf{A} $, the determinant can be computed by expanding along any row or column. The formula for the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{1j} C_{1j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{1j}$ is the cofactor of the element $a_{1j}$. The cofactor is given by: $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}$, where $M_{ij}$ is the minor of the element $a_{ij}$, which is the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing the $i$-th row and $j$-th column from $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a recursive definition of the determinant, as each cofactor $C_{ij}$ is itself the determinant of a smaller matrix. The base case is the determinant of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, which is computed as:\n",
    "$$\\text{det}(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}) = ad - bc$$"

For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the absolute value of the determinant represents the area of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors of the matrix. In three dimensions, the absolute value of the determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix represents the volume of the parallelepiped formed by its column vectors. For higher dimensions, the determinant represents the hypervolume of the parallelepiped formed by the column vectors."
