    "# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we start by considering a vector that does not change direction when a linear transformation is applied to it. Such a vector is called an eigenvector of the transformation, and the factor by which it is scaled is called the eigenvalue. This is captured in the following equation:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a square matrix representing the linear transformation, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the eigenvector, and $\\lambda$ is a scalar eigenvalue. For a non-trivial solution (i.e., $\\mathbf{v} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$), the following condition must hold:\n",
    "$$\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Solving this polynomial equation yields the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, and substituting these back into the original equation allows us to find the corresponding eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the characteristic polynomial by calculating $\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})$.\n",
    "2. Solve the characteristic polynomial for $\\lambda$ to find the eigenvalues.\n",
    "3. For each eigenvalue, substitute it back into the equation $(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v} = 0$ to find the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is hard to implement from scratch in a purely numerical way. Most modern algorithms use iterative methods to approximate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In practice, libraries such as NumPy provide efficient implementations for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors using optimized algorithms. For us, we will use symbolic computation via SymPy to derive exact expressions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demostrates how to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors using SymPy. Notice that we convert the resulting values to complex numbers to handle cases where eigenvalues or eigenvectors may be complex."
