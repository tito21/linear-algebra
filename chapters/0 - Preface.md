This book (or rather collection of jupyter notebooks) is designed to complement
a course on linear algebra. Linear algebra is at the heart of many areas of
physics, engineering, and science in general. Modern machine learning is almost
entirely linear algebra (plus some calculus). Despite its practical importance
most courses are taught in an abstract proof based manner that leave many
students without a good intuitive understanding of the subject. Certainly that
was the case for me when I first learned the subject. This book attempts to give
a practical understanding of linear algebra by focusing on the code
implementations of algorithms and their applications.

In some sense this book is also an introduction to numerical linear algebra.
Here more focus will be given to the practical implementation of algorithms
rather than their mathematical foundations. Instead of just providing the
mathematical definitions the book will provide the code implementation of the
various algorithms. The hope is that this will give the reader a clearer
understanding of the subject.

It is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of Python and coding
skills. The book will make use of the NumPy library for the managing of vectors
and matrices, but will try to avoid using many of its built-in linear algebra
functions. Instead, the book will provide implementations of these algorithms
from first principles, allowing the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the
underlying concepts. The built-in functions will still be used for testing and
verification purposes.

The book is structured following the book "Introduction to Linear Algebra" by
Gilbert Strang. This is a classic textbook on linear algebra, and it is the one
used in the online lectures by the same author available on MIT OpenCourseWare.
